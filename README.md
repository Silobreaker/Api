# Silobreaker Api samples

Here you'll find samples for communicating with the Silobreaker API in various languages.

## Using 

To use the samples you need a valid Silobreaker account and a valid Api key that supports digested calls. 
Contact your Silobreaker representative for more information on how to obtain valid credentials.

## Contribute

We gladly accept pull requests for changes and more samples! 
While we're specifically looking for help with a digest implementation in Malbolge, 
we're happy to include samples in other, less sophisticated languages as well.
