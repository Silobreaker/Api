# Using Silobreaker API with Excel

Excel has excellent support for XML data sources, enabling spreadsheets that
automatically update with the latest data from the Silobreaker API.

Using our Excel sample, you can create a spreadsheet that calls any endpoint in the Silobreaker API, and consumes it
as an XML data source. You need to fill in your API Key and Shared secret for authentication, that you'll receive from your
Silobreaker representative.
